# Airline Database Management and Retrieval

So you want to detection traffice signs hey? Well fear not...you can do this...I believe in you. But also, the code is below üòâ. This notebook walks you through downloading the dataset from @andrewmvd's collection, converting the annotations from Pascal VOC to YOLO and last but not least rendering the bounding boxes within your Notebook using OpenCV and Matplotlib. Happy Coding ‚úåÔ∏è

## Project Objective

. Use SQL commands to display the contents of relational database tables.
. Use SQL commands to insert, update, and delete data rows.
. Use SQL to query and retrieve data lists to answer different business questions.
. Generate a data list based on joining different data tables.

## Project Scenario
Your domestic airline client needs help retrieving and manipulating information from their database management system (DBMS). The airline‚Äôs database provides details about aircraft specifics, airplanes, flight schedules, and routes from different airports of cities and states. Airplanes are assigned to diverse flight routes where each flight route has a unique flight number, departs and arrives at particular airports at different cities in scheduled time. You will apply your SQL command skills to the airline‚Äôs database management system (DBMS) to help answer the company‚Äôs business questions.

## Key Tasks
In this project, we will implement several SQL commands, and practice data manipulation operations and information retrieval to answer several business questions for your client. Your submission will include all required SQL commands with the command execution output and a brief write-up in a single Word document.

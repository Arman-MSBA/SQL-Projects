# Airline Database Management and Retrieval

## Project Scenario
The domestic airline client needs help retrieving and manipulating information from their database management system (DBMS). The airline’s database provides details about aircraft specifics, airplanes, flight schedules, and routes from different airports of cities and states. Airplanes are assigned to diverse flight routes where each flight route has a unique flight number, departs and arrives at particular airports at different cities in scheduled time. We will apply your SQL command skills to the airline’s database management system (DBMS) to help answer the company’s business questions.

## Project Objective

1. Use SQL commands to display the contents of relational database tables.
2. Use SQL commands to insert, update, and delete data rows.
3. Use SQL to query and retrieve data lists to answer different business questions.
4. Generate a data list based on joining different data tables.


## Key Tasks
In this project, we will implement several SQL commands, and practice data manipulation operations and information retrieval to answer several business questions for the client. Submission includes all required SQL commands with the command execution output and a brief write-up in a single Word document.
